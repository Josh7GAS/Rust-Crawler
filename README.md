# Rust-Crawler
Is a Crawler made in rust
To have it you need to download rust and cargo.

Rust is the language and Cargo is the package-manager for rust programs.

ways to install rust and cargo: Windows -> https://rustup.rs/# | Linux -> do the following command "curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh"

when Rust is instaleted, run "cargo install rust_crawler" on the command line to have the application.

Other Ways.
==========
If you prefer to clone the repository or if the above dosen't work, just clone the project, go to the path: "Rust-Crawler/rust_crawler/src" and run the command "cargo run".

*Beware that you need Rust and cargo instaleted*

*If not work try to use rustup after the instalation and follow the process on screen*

Thank you.
